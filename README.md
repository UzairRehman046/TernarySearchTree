# Ternary Search Tree (TST) Project

This project implements a **Ternary Search Tree (TST)** in Python â€” a specialized data structure for efficient string storage and retrieval, combining properties of both binary search trees and tries. This implementation supports:

###  Functions

Insertion of strings (including the empty string)
Searching with prefix or exact match behavior
Counting and listing stored words
Pretty-printing the tree structure
Code benchmarking with performance plots
HPC execution via SLURM on KU Leuven Genius cluster
